Taught Game Development using Scratch and Design in 5 schools, all conducted in-person (offline). A key highlight was traveling to Cairo, Egypt, to mentor students at Sekolah Indonesia Cairo, expanding the programâ€™s impact internationally.

Throughout this program, I had the opportunity to teach at:

- Sekolah Indonesia Cairo (Cairo, Egypt) â€“ Taught Game Development using Scratch to Indonesian students abroad (60+ students), introducing fundamental coding concepts through interactive projects using Scratch.

- Al-Anshar Islamic School â€“ Focused on Design for 20+ students, guiding them in creative visual projects and digital art.

- Sekolah Alam - School of Universe â€“ Introduced Game Development using Scratch to 20+ students through hands-on learning and interactive challenges.

- International Islamic Boarding School Al-Andalus â€“ Conducted Game Development using Scratch workshops for 30+ students, helping them build their own simple games.

- SDIT Nurul Hikmah â€“ Provided training on Game Development using Scratch for 120+ students, engaging them in large-scale project-based learning sessions.

This experience significantly enhanced my teaching skills, public speaking, cross-cultural communication, and adaptability in diverse learning environments, while also expanding my professional network within the IDN Talents community. ðŸš€
